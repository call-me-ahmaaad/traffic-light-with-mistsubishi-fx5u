# Description

This is a simple project in the form of a traffic light simulation using PLC and Node-red. The PLC used is Mitsubishi FX5U-64MR/ES and the application for programming the PLC is GX Works 3. The communication used is Modbus TCP.

There are no actuators or inputs to enter values ​​that I connect to the PLC. This is my first practice to operate and learn PLC again from the beginning. Maybe in the future I will use PLC from OMRON and the C-ONE application.

The PLC I use is from Mitsubishi FX5U-64MR/ES series with the application I use to program it is GX Works 3, and with an ethernet cable to connect the PLC and my laptop.

I also made another simulation using Node-RED. For the simulation that I made, I made it into two parts, the first is a simulation using the MC protocol and the second is using the Modbus TCP protocol. To create the simulation display, I also installed node-red-dashboard to make the display more interactive.

# Features

This project can simulate a traffic light system with a predetermined time. This system is also equipped with a switch that can turn the entire system off or on without having to turn off the simulation mode in GX Works 3.
